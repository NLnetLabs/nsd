Name Server Daemon (NSD) by NLnet Labs
======================================

Welcome to the documentation of the NLnet Labs Name Server Daemon (NSD), an
authoritative DNS name server. It has been developed for operations in
environments where speed, reliability, stability and security are of high
importance.

NSD is designed with a pure philosophy that prioritises raw performance. This
means that if you serve hundreds of thousands or even millions of queries per
second, NSD is the leading implementation in the world. This authoritative DNS
name server strives to be a reference implementation for emerging standards of
the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF). NSD is distributed free of charge in
open source form under the BSD license. For most platforms, `packages
<https://repology.org/project/nsd/versions>`_ are available.

This documentation is an open source project maintained by NLnet Labs. is edited
via text files in the `reStructuredText
<http://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/stable/rest.html>`_ markup language and then
compiled into a static website/offline document using the open source `Sphinx
<http://www.sphinx-doc.org>`_ and `ReadTheDocs <https://readthedocs.org/>`_
