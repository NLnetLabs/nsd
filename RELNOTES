NSD RELEASE NOTES

2.2.0
=============
FEATURES:
        - nsd-xfer: replacement program for named-xfer to perform zone
          transfers using AXFR. TSIG is supported by nsd-xfer but not
          yet by the nsd server. DNSSEC is also supported.  TSIG
          requires the OpenSSL library, configure using --disable-tsig
          if you do not have OpenSSL installed.

CODE CHANGES:
        - New data structure 'buffer_type' for representing binary
          buffers that can be read, written, and resized.  Data in
          these buffers is stored in network byte order.  This data
          structure replaces the iobuf field of 'struct query'.

BUG FIXES:
        - Fixed endian problem in WKS record.
        - Protocol can now be specified numerically in WKS record.
        - Allow escape sequences (\DDD) in TTL, RR class, and RR type.
        - The zone compiler now accepts many more characters in
          unquoted strings such as domain name labels.  The characters
          no longer need to be escaped with a backslash.
        - Close included files after reading.
        - Maximum TCP message size is now 65535 bytes.  AXFR response
          packets are still limited to 16383 bytes for optimal
          compression of dnames.
        - The TSIG key for AXFRs can now also be stored in the file
          <zonename>.tsiginfo.  This makes it possible to use TSIG
          with multiple master servers.
        - Signals are no longer blocked while performing I/O so the
          server should respond quicker to signals.

2.1.5
=============
BUG FIXES:
        - Bug #90: handle \000 in TXT records correctly
        - Fixed undefined behavior in the use of vsnprintf when
          logging messages.  This caused crashes on Linux/PPC.

2.1.4
=============
BUG FIXES:
        - nsdc: Fixed a typo that caused AXFRs to stop working.

2.1.3
=============
FEATURES:
        - nsd: The pidfile can be specified using the '-P' option.

BUG FIXES:
        - Bug #87: allow @ in the rdata
        - Bug #88: allow ::FFFF:ipv4addr in AAAA records
        - Bug #89: Count the number of queries received over TCP,
          instead of the number of TCP connections.
        - Zonec: when - is used as input, set the filename to 'STDIN'.
        - The nsdc script handles failed AXFRs more gracefully.
        - NSD emits an error when it sees bitlabels (RFC 2673).
        - Only copy the CD bit when DNSSEC is enabled.

2.1.2
=============
FEATURES:
        - NSD now fully supports unknown record types using the
          notation specified in RFC3597.
        - Support for the following RR types has been added: WKS, X25,
          ISDN, RT, NSAP, PX, NAPTR, KX, CERT, DNAME, and APL.  DNAME
          special processing is not supported.

BUG FIXES:
        - Bug #84: NSD now uses SIGUSR1 instead of SIGILL to report stats.
        - Bug #85: Support for WKS records.
        - Bug #86: The characters "#%&^[]?" can now be used without
          backslash in zone file domain names.
        - Plugin callback return type fixed.
        - The maximum message length for IPv6 UDP packets is now
          limited to the IPv6 minimum MTU (1280) unless the
          IPV6_USE_MIN_MTU socket option is supported.

2.1.1
=============
BUG FIXES:
        - Bug #81: Handle unknown types correctly.
        - Bug #82: Zonec: don't report "0 errors" unless -v is
          specified.
        - Bug #83: Close zone files after parsing.
        - Handle AFSDB RR type.

2.1.0
=============
FEATURES:
        - New networking code allows a single server to handle both
          UDP and TCP connections.  By default up to 10 simultaneous
          TCP connections are supported.  Use the '-n' flag to change
          the default.

2.0.2
=============
BUG FIXES:
        - Allow the use of a mnemonic for the algorithm field of a
          DNSKEY record.
        - Behavior of the zonec -v flag has been modified.  By default
          zonec will only print a single line with a summary of the
          error count.
        - Bug #75: Fixed typo in previous "fix".

2.0.1
=============
BUG FIXES:
        - Queries for QTYPE DS (DNSSEC) were not handled correctly in
          certain cases.
        - Partial support for unknown RRs.  Known RR types with
          unknown RR data format is not yet supported.
        - Bug #75: Fixed bad error message when nsdc update is run for
          the first time.
        - Bug #78: Multiple zones, each with include directives, are
          now compiled correctly.

2.0.0
=============
FEATURES:
        - Experimental DNSSEC support implemented, but disabled by
          default.  Enable using the --enable-dnssec configuration
          option.
        - IPv6 enabled by default.  Disable using the --disable-ipv6
          configuration option.

BUG FIXES:
        - Bug #47: Domain name is now logged when a notify is
          received.
        - Bug #70: First include all A records in the additional
          section, followed by AAAA records.
        - Bug #77: Check length of domain name and label.
        - LOC records are supported again.

1.4.0-alpha1
=============
FEATURES:
        - New database format that is much more compact and portable
          across architectures.
        - The new zone compiler is now the default and the old zone
          compiler has been removed.
        - Name compression is done dynamically, removing one other
          difference with BIND in the responses generated (the full
          query name is now used for compression).
        - CNAME target records are now generated from wildcard
          records if necessary.

REGRESSIONS:
        - mmap(2) isn't currently supported.
        - Not all RR types are supported by zonec (such as LOC).

1.3.0-alpha1
=============
FEATURES:
        - New name lookup algorithm.  This required a change to the
          database format.  Performance should increase at the expense
          of database size and memory usage.
        - New zone compiler (zonec2) based on flex and yacc, fully RFC
          compliant (still in alpha).
        - Database can be loaded using mmap(2) (use the --enable-mmap
          configure option to enable).  This is useful on operating
          systems such as Solaris that do not allow memory overcommit.
        - Region based memory allocation and resource management.
        - New internal format for storing domain names.  Each dname
          now includes an array of label offsets within the domain
          name.
        - Updates to the plugin API.

BUG FIXES:
        - Bug #65: The syslog facility is now a compile time option
          (--with-facility=FACILITY).  The default facility is DAEMON.
        - Bug #66: Automatic periodic dumping of the statistics (using
          the -s option) is now continued after a database reload.

1.2.4
=============
BUG FIXES:
        - Bug #72: If an RRset for a child domain is defined before
          the RRset of the parent domain the parent's RRset would be
          "lost".

1.2.3
=============
BUG FIXES:
        - Bug #65: The syslog facility is now a compile time option
          (--with-facility=FACILITY).  The default facility is DAEMON.
        - Bug #66: Automatic periodic dumping of the statistics (using
          the -s option) is now continued after a database reload.
        - NSD would try to kill pid -1 on startup if forking of a child
          process failed.
        - Do not log EAGAIN errors on calls to recvfrom.  These errors
          should be harmless.

1.2.2
=============
BUG FIXES:
        - Bug #59: NSD returns FORMERR when the query name is >= 246
          bytes.
        - Bug #60: Zonec runs out of file descriptors with many zones.
        - Bug #61: nsdc uses /bin/sh hardwired (and should not).
        - Bug #62: NSD is not able to log to a file.
        - Bug #63: nsdc update and zonec are too tallkative.
        - Bug #64: Answer for request of a host resolved by a
          wildcard-resource-record is not understandable by dig.

1.2.1
=============
BUG FIXES:
        - AXFR terminates early if a zone containa a CNAME pointing
          the the zone's domain name (SOA record) (bug #56).
        - During an AXFR memory above the top of the stack was
          accessed.  This could lead to occassional AXFR errors (bad
          packets).
        - NSD now prints its version number and exits when invoked
          with the -v flag (bug #57).
        - NSD prints help information and exits when invoked with the
          -h flag.

1.2.0
=============
FEATURES:
        - NSD is now a single parent process (handling child
          termination and database reloads) plus multiple UDP and TCP
          child processes handling queries.  Before the parent process
          also handled UDP queries.  This change simplifies the parent
          and child processes and allows the use of multiple
          concurrent UDP servers.
        - Experimental plugin support.  This required a minor,
          incompatible change to the database format.  Make sure you
          recompile your database.  Use --enable-plugins to enable.
        - Full IPv6 support (for multi-homing and for Linux, thanks to
          Colm MacCárthaigh and Jun-ichiro itojun Hagino).  Use
          --enable-ipv6 to enable.
        - Support for multi-homing with TCP connections.
        - Support for SunOS 4.x has been dropped.

CODE CHANGES:
        - NSD should now conform to the Single Unix Specification
          (http://www.unix.org/).
        - Const correctness for strings and some other data types.
        - Removed code for Berkeley DB, hash tables, and mmap(2).
        - Separate preprocessor flags from code flags (CPPFLAGS and
          CFLAGS).
        - Use uint8_t instead of u_char, uint{16,32}_t instead of
          u_int{16,32}_t.
        - Fixed warnings from mixing signed and unsigned types.
        - Use sigaction(2) instead of signal(2).
        - The query_process function has been split up for clarity.

BUG FIXES:
        - CHAOS TXT queries failed on big-endian machines.
        - Portability fixes for Tru64 (thanks to Stephane Bortzmeyer),
          HP-UX, and MacOS X (thanks to Ronald van der Pol).
        - Removed compile time limit on maximum number of TCP child
          servers.
        - Support for debugging UDP and TCP queries.
        - Always ensure there is enough room for the EDNS record when
          answering a query with EDNS enabled.

1.0.0 RELEASE
=============

KNOWN BUGS:

  use it as so called ``cached'' non-authoritative data, it is decided
  that having this functionality is wrong, dangerous and will be removed
  from the further versions.

- If while processing EDNS(0) OPT record NSD encounters bad EDNS(0)
  version it will answer with Format Error instead of EDNS(0) BADVERS
