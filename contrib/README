This is NSD contributions directory and it contains various additions
to NSD that are not a part of the official distribution but may be
helpfull.

USE AT YOUR OWN RISK.

* nsd.spec: a rpm specfile to generate binary and source rpms. 
  Put the source tarball in  /usr/src/redhat/SOURCES. Then 
  	rpmbuild -ba nsd.spec

* nsd.zones2nsd.conf: a python script to convert NSD 2 nsd.zones config files
  to NSD 3 nsd.conf config files. Do not forget to set nsd_zones_name and
  key_dir variables at the top of the script. 

* bind2nsd: not included, find it at http://bind2nsd.sourceforge.net
  The project builds scripts that translate DNS information in BIND format 
  to NSD format, and then copy that translation to an NSD server. The goal 
  is to make it simple to run redundant BIND and NSD servers and keep them 
  in sync, using only the BIND configuration files
