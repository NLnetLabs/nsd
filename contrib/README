This is NSD contributions directory and it contains various additions
to NSD that are not a part of the official distribution but may be
helpful.

USE AT YOUR OWN RISK.

* nsd.spec: a rpm specfile to generate binary and source rpms. 
  Put the source tarball in  /usr/src/redhat/SOURCES. Then 
  	rpmbuild -ba nsd.spec

* nsd.init: a shell script that can start, stop, restart the NSD daemon.
  It uses signals, and can be used in rc.d init scripts (depends on platform).

* nsd.zones2nsd.conf: a python script to convert NSD 2 nsd.zones config files
  to NSD 3 nsd.conf config files. Do not forget to set nsd_zones_name and
  key_dir variables at the top of the script. 

* bind2nsd: a slightly abridged form is included; find the full source
  at http://bind2nsd.sourceforge.net.  The bind2nsd scripts translate 
  DNS information in BIND format to NSD format, and then copy that 
  translation to an NSD server. The goal is to make it simple to run
  redundant BIND and NSD servers and keep them in sync, using only the
  BIND configuration files

* nsd_munin_ : plugin for munin statistics report
  You must have given --enable-bind8-stats (default is on) to configure.
  Copy the file to /usr/share/munin/plugins (or you munin node dir).
  You may also need to create a number of symbolic links under the names
  of the graphs you want to create (documented at head of file).

* nsd.service : example systemd service script for NSD.

* patch_for_s6_startup_and_other_service_supervisors.diff : patch to
  use -r option for nsd to signal readiness with READY_FD, from Cameron Nemo.
  Apply with patch -p0 < contrib/patch_for_s6_startup_and_other_service_supervisors.diff

* autocomplete_nsd-control.bash : It completes options, all commands and zone
  arguments for commands. From Christian Weiske. To use it, call:
  source contrib/autocomplete_nsd-control.bash

* bug390.patch:
  Patch that returns a superfluous NSEC3 RR on wildcard queries

  This patch exists because there is a bug in the Bind9 resolver, before
  version 9.9.0. Bind9 before that version can not validate NSEC3 wildcard
  answer responses, it needs a superfluous NSEC3 RR. This patch will make
  NSD provide that NSEC3 RR.

  The patch was useful before there was a fix for the BIND resolver, to
  work around the issue. It is no longer useful after BIND got fixed in
  version 9.9.0 around 2013-05-16.

* contrib/nsd-tmpfiles.conf.in, contrib/nsd.openrc.conf, contrib/nsd.openrc.in:
  An OpenRC service script and config file.

  The service script is integrated with the build system so that the
  correct paths are obtained from ./configure and do not need to be
  hard-coded.

  The nsd-tmpfiles.conf file is for both systemd and OpenRC. If installed,
  this will create at a boot a temporary "nsd" directory writable by the
  nsd user. This makes it easier to use a local control socket because
  the user no longer has to worry about creating the directory where
  the socket will live.
